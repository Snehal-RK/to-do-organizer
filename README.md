# To-Do List Web Application

This is a responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively with features like adding, completing, deleting, filtering, reordering, and theme customization. The application also persists data using `localStorage`.

## Features Implemented

* **Add, complete, and delete tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list, mark them as complete with a checkbox, and remove them when no longer needed.
* **Light/dark theme toggle:** Switch between a light and a dark visual theme for comfortable use in different environments. Your preferred theme is saved for future sessions.
* **Filtering by task status:** View all tasks, only pending tasks, or only completed tasks using the filter buttons.
* **Drag-and-drop task reordering:** Reorganize your tasks by simply dragging and dropping them into your desired order. This order is saved.
* **Data persistence:** Your tasks and theme preference are saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so your list persists even after you close the browser.
* **Task editing:** Modify the text of existing tasks to correct typos or update descriptions.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
* **Enhanced User Interface and Experience:** Includes a clean and intuitive layout with clear visual cues and smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* `localStorage` for data persistence
